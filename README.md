### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Dear, Reader:

I'm Amy! A 3rd Year **University of Waterloo** student studying **CS, Statistics, Combinatorics & Optimization**. 

I like to think of myself almost like a stem cell. That is: being continuously adaptable, curious, and open-minded in my search for issues to tackle with positively impactful software. My degree also allows me to process these problems with a mathematical edge.

My previous internships and side projects have allowed me to explore **web development, test automation, and leadership in project management**. Continuous learning leads the way!

ðŸ“Š To stay true to my degree, here is some data:
* Languages: C, C++, Assembly, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, (amongst English, Mandarin, and French!)
* Technologies: Git, ReactJS, RestfulAPI, SQL, Bash, Sentry, Segment, Optimizely, Figma, Fullstory, TestIM

Come find me on my [**website**](https://personalwebsite-sage.vercel.app/), or chat over [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyzhuo/)!

Thanks for visiting my Github profile :)
